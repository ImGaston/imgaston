# Hi there 👋 

## 👨🏽‍💻 About me
I am a **Revenue Management Specialist** focused on optimizing short-term rental profitability. My 10 years in business give me a global vision of a product, allowing me to understand the problems it solves and the audience it serves.

I have a mindset in constant search for improvement and growth. Today, my expertise in revenue management, automation, and market analysis enables me to develop data-driven solutions, helping property managers maximize their earnings. I also work on personal coding projects, using data analysis and automation to enhance pricing strategies and operational efficiency. I am looking to expand these capabilities within a team, leveraging technology, data, and strategy to drive success.
